# Badge Request
If you want your ***VERY*** own name badge, use the template below when making a pull request. I will add yours ASAP (most likely adding in batches).
```

**Note that you can only have one badge. If you ever want your badge to be updated, make another pull request using the template above, but add on "UPDATE REQUEST".**
