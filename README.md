# Badge Request
I get it, you want your **VERY OWN** custom name badge, but you may be wondering to yourself, "omG lUCkFiRE HoW dO gET CoOL nAMeBAdge/!?!?" well.. the process is a lot simpler than you would think. Make an **[issue request](https://github.com/Discord-Theme-Addons/discord-name-badges/issues/new)** on this repo, and fill out the form. I'll update to give you your badge as soon as I can. Be on the lookout for your badge being added because usually hoof or I close the issue request and comment on it when I add it. Once I've added your badge, make sure you update the theme to get it!
- **NOTE: IMAGES MUST BE HOSTED ON A TRUSTED DOMAIN (such as i.imgur or cdn.discordapp) AND SHOULD BE THE SAME WIDTHxHEIGHT TO PREVENT IT FROM LOOKING WEIRD**

# Installation
