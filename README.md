# Badge Request
If you want your ***VERY*** own name badge, use the template below when making a pull request (https://github.com/LuckFire/NameBadges/pulls). I will add yours ASAP (most likely adding in batches). Images must be hosted on i.imgur or cdn.discordapp.
```
Username and Discrim: 
User ID: 
Image Link: 
```
Note that you are only allowed to have one badge, if you at any time want your badge updated, make another pull request but add on "UPDATE REQUEST" or something similar to indicate that you're wanting your badge updated.
